## Summary
BCG DV incubation for HeyCar in partnership with Volkswagen Financial Services in Germany. Nine months building and 
launching the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), an online used car platform that combines the best dealers with the best 
cars without hosting ads.

Working primarily as part of the frontend team (two people), but with regular involvement and development on the 
backend team. We worked daily side-by-side with the design team to translate designs into a responsive web app written 
in React with Redux. We had and maintained 100% test coverage in the frontend using testing tools such as Jest and 
Enzyme, all deployed in an automated CI pipeline using Travis CI (deployed to our kubernetes cluster).

Shortly after our successful market launch in Germany, HeyCar expanded to the UK, and has since entered other markets
(see: [heycar Group](https://heycargroup.com/)). HeyCar re-used much of our existing codebase during the UK expansion, 
which we built from scratch during the initial incubation.

## Role & Responsibilities
- Building out MVP web application for HeyCar (used car marketplace)
- Working closely with the design team to implement, test and verify their UI designs
- Responsive web development & cross-browser testing
- Automated testing using Jest & Enzyme, deployed as an automated pipeline via Travis CI
- Additional work on the backend team; primarily API development
- Interviewing & on-boarding technical candidates for the new HeyCar team
