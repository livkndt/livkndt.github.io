## Summary
I was part of the initial European team in May 2019, consisting of just four software engineers (following a successful
pilot out of Sydney, Australia). We built OpenSC's core platform from scratch. In January 2020, I took the role of 
Lead Engineer for the Platform team. I have been operating as Head of Engineering since February 2022.

OpenSC's Data Science and Engineering team is responsible for developing the core platform that allows customers to
verify, trace and share information about their supply chains. We are developing algorithms to make sustainability 
claims in an automated fashion. For example, we use readily available GPS data from fishing vessels with a 
machine-learning algorithm to detect whether vessels are fishing in protected ocean zones.

We also enable digital supply chain traceability for our customers. The data is stored immutably on a public blockchain 
to provide a layer of tamper-proof auditability.

This sustainability and traceability data can be made available to end consumers of supply chain products. The aim is 
to help them learn about the origin and journey of the products they buy and help them make more informed buying decisions.
