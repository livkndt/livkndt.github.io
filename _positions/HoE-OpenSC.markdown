## Summary
I have been working with OpenSC since May 2019 and since then, have taken on the role of Software Engineering Lead for the Platform team.
The Platform team is responsible for developing OpenSC's core platform that allows customers to verify, trace and share their supply chains.
We are developing algorithms to make sustainability claims about supply chains in an automated fashion; for example using readily available GPS 
data from fishing vessels along with a machine learning algorithm and other data to detect whether vessels are fishing in protected areas of the 
ocean. We enable customers to trace their supply chains and the data is stored immutably on the public blockchain. All of this data can then be 
provided to end consumers of those products to help them understand the origins and journeys of their products and make more informed, conscious 
buying decisions.

## Role & Responsibilities
- Part of the initial team (May 2019) responsible for building OpenSC's core platform from scratch, including our public API.
- Responsible for driving the evolution of the platform and overseeing and taking architectural decisions.
- Development across the entire stack, research spikes & architecture design.
- Managing relationships with partners/external stakeholders.
- Accountable for team delivery.
- Hiring across the Platform team inc. engineering, design & product.
- Coaching team (of 5) & promoting a good working culture.
- Evolving & improving team processes.
