## Summary
Between my time at Next Jump and my move to Berlin, Germany to join BCG Digital Ventures, I worked as a
freelance full-stack web developer. I worked across multiple projects before my freelance career was (with no regrets)
cut short to move to a new country.

The work I did included an online management system for RRP (Reducing Reoffending Partnerships, 
for the Ministry of Justice), work on a digital transformation at Lloyds Banking Group (via Wipro Digital).
