# Fleabag Quotes API
A mini node express app that I wrote to serve as a REST API for Fleabag quotes. My aim was to capture some best
practices I've picked up over the years and get back into coding after a stint of heavy management and DevOps focus at 
the start of a new job. Read more in the [blog post](/2023/08/04/fleabag-api.html).

I don't have much time to maintain or improve it, but it still brings me joy from time to time. I'm just sad there's no
more episodes to look forward to ðŸ¥² (but maybe that's the beauty).

### ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip
One thing that brought me a lot of joy was using this as a dynamic cover for Notion pages. I use Notion as my main 
personal documentation tool... Here's how you can do it too:
```
# Get a random image with a width of 1800px and a height of 600px
https://fleabag-quotes.livkndt.com/quotes/random/inspirational?imageWidth=1800&imageHeight=600
```
- Click "Change Cover"
- Select the "Link" tab
- Paste the URL with chosen dimensions (I found 1800x600 to be a good fit)
- Click "Submit"
- Admire your Fleabag quote cover
- Refresh the page to get a new quote

### ðŸš€ Usage
Get a random quote from the critically acclaimed TV series, "Fleabag":
```

```
