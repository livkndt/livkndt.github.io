**Personal information you disclose to us**

*In Short*: We collect personal information that you provide to us.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining 
information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, 
or otherwise when you contact us.

**Sensitive Information**. We do not process sensitive information.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us 
of any changes to such personal information.

characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services. This information is only collected if you 
click "Accept" on the site's cookie banner (please refer to our [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy.html)).

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does 
not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage 
information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, 
referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other 
technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, 
and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Note: automated data collection is done via Google Analytics, and we make use of the IP anonymization feature provided,

servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how 
you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and 
information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and 
files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information 
(such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings).
- *Device Data*. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you 
use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP 
address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, 
Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
- *Location Data*. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either 
precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to 
access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us 
your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either 
by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to 
opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

## 3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?

*In Short*: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal 
reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide 
you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil 
our legitimate business interests.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in 
order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process 
your personal information:

- **Consent**. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal 
information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.
- **Legitimate Interests**. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our 
legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. 
For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
- Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users
- Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities
- **Legal Obligations**. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal 
obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal 
rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
- **Vital Interests**. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests 
or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

## 4. When and with whom do we share your personal information?

*In Short*: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with 
the following third parties.

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

## 5. How long do we keep your information?

*In Short*: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy 
notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy 
notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal 
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 26 months.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or 
anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been 
stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any 
further processing until deletion is possible.

## 6. Do we collect information from minors?

*In Short*: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, 
you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to 
such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years 
of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such 
data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please 
contact us at livkndt_dev_2023@icloud.com.

that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or 
terminate your account at any time.

In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may 
include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request 
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, 
to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your

the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by 
using the contact details provided in the section 'How can you contact us about this notice?' below.

## 8. Controls for do-not-track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature 
or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities 
monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has 
been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically 
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow 
in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

## 9. Do California residents have specific privacy rights?

*In Short*: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access 
to your personal information.

residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal 
information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all 
third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a 
California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the 
contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the 
right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data,
