Inspired by Accenture's International Women's Day question "How far can you go?" this event gave young women from 
across the UK the opportunity to share their tech stories, drawing on personal experiences - 
both positive and challenging.

# **Accenture â€“ International Women's Day: How Far Can You Go?**

I was invited to join the 7-hour public speaking bootcamp, and along with another young woman and the help of an 
Accenture mentor, came up with a talk around the theme of "How far can you go?". You can watch our segment on YouTube.
