In June 2018, BCG Digital Ventures hosted a talk night in collaboration with 
[Women Who Code Berlin](https://www.womenwhocode.com/berlin). Along with helping to organise the event, I also gave a 
talk about the methodology used at BCG DV for building and launching start-ups into the market fast, whilst still 
maintaining a high standard of quality.
