For International Women's Day 2018, I was involved in a speaker series at BCG DV Berlin, with the goal of exchanging
perspectives on leadership, collaboration, diversity, and transformation in our personal and professional lives.

# No Guts No Glory

I wrote & led a discussion where I interviewed two inspirational women in my lives that covered a broad spectrum of 
topics with the audience, including how to face personal fears, navigating transitions and career planning. 
It was an absolute pleasure & a wonderful experience.
