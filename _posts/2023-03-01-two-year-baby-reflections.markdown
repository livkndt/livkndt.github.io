My daughter is very nearly two! I can't believe how quickly the time has gone... it's a good time to look back and reflect 
on how it all went. I've certainly changed, learned a lot and just about figured out how to adapt to a new reality and 
a new way of working.

# Reflections on two years of parenthood

## A new-found respect for parents everywhere
I have a new-found respect for parents of any kind. Whether you've chosen to stay at home or go back to work - having a child completely shakes up your existence in ways you never imagined.
It's hard

I've got through days and weeks on less sleep than I'd ever imagined, and I'm somehow keeping it together (just about). Some will tell you the sleep woes will end, others tell you that your children will be disturbing yor sleep for some reason for the rest of your life.




## Things have changed... forever!
i dont think i ever thought much beyond the baby stages! it was a fast and almost sinking

## It's all about outlook and perspective
my highs and lows are higher and lower than ever. when im in the midst of no sleep, nursery illness and a piling workload - everything feels terrible.
i cant afford to not look after myself any more. i need to read, exercise, sleep as best i can and eat well.

## Our transition to more flexible and more remote working has been a blessing
I used to get by on a lot of overtime. Work isn't done? Just squeeze in a couple of extra hours.
That just doesn't work anymore when you're a parent, at least of young children; you have to be somewhere on time to pick them up,
and from that point on it's a full time job and they need feeding, bathing, playing with. Sure you might be able to squeeze in a bit extra once their in bed,
but you're edging yourself towards burn out of you make that a habit.
I leave home around 5 for nursery pickup - and the day just flies by.
If i had to squeeze in an hour long commute to a london office twice a day, im not sure how id manage.
i know there are many parents out there managing - and it's incredible!
im thankful to be in tech which feels much more forward thinking when it comes to wfh and flexibility - i can change my hours to fit my needs, within reason.
