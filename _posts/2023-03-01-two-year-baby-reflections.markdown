My daughter is very nearly two! I can't believe how quickly the time has gone... it's a good time to look back and reflect 
on how it all went. I've certainly changed, learned a lot and just about figured out how to adapt to a new reality and 
a new way of working.

# Reflections on two years of parenthood

## A new-found respect for parents everywhere

## Things have changed... forever!

## It's all about outlook and perspective

## Our transition to more flexible and more remote working has been a blessing
