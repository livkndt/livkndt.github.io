This was a [guest blog post](https://medium.com/bcgdv-engineering/working-in-harmony-using-design-systems-for-better-collaboration-57a5dae53d65)
for BCG Digital Ventures' blog on Medium. I talk about our experience of building a Design System early, and how that
can enable engineers and designers to collaborate more efficiently and creatively.
