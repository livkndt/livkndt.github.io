Clear communication is one of the most important soft skills a software engineer needs to thrive in their career. Itâ€™s 
not easy, especially as an introvert and depending on the environment youâ€™re working in; though employers (and all of us) 
should strive to create safe teams & spaces for everyone to share ideas with ease, there are also practical things we can 
do as individuals to improve how we communicate.

As a junior & even a senior engineer, I was terrified to speak during meetings about technical topics or to present my 
work in front of people. Overcoming that had a significant impact on my career and accelerated my growth.

It started with Toastmasters sessions at work (my ex-Next Jump colleagues will remember that!). After that, I took every 
opportunity to practice speaking in the tech community with groups like Women Who Code and at work. When it came to 
speaking up in meetings, I took advice from a mentor to try being the first to say something in every meeting, which 
really worked; facing the fear at the beginning of the meeting helped settle my nerves for the rest of it and made a big 
difference over time. Different tactics work for different people, and sometimes, youâ€™ve got to try a few ideas and see 
what works for you.

Look for opportunities to practice in small steps and find someone you trust to give feedback on your communication. 
Some ideas:
ðŸ’¡ Daily stand-ups â€” be clear & concise, convey the important info
ðŸ’¡ Engineering knowledge-sharing sessions, brown bags, all-hands â€” share tech knowledge with technical people
ðŸ’¡ Sprint demos â€” present your work and explain technical topics to potentially non-technical people
ðŸ’¡ Code Pairing sessions â€” clearly explain your thought process whilst coding with another
ðŸ’¡ Community sessions & events â€” opportunities to present in front of different, bigger audiences
ðŸ’¡ Targeted communication training or meetups â€” does your company offer communication training, Toastmasters or similar? 
meetup.com is also a great place to browse

I still find it hard & itâ€™s likely a forever journey, but building these skills over the years helps me face the fear 
and do it anyway!
