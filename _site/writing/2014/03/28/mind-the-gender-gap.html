<p><em>Author: Kayleigh Bateman</em>
<em>Publication: Computer Weekly</em>
<em>Published: 28 March 2014 11:49</em></p>

<p><em>This is a guest blog from Olivia Rose Graham, software engineer at Next Jump.</em></p>

<p>One of the main reasons that I got into computer science is influence from my father ‚Äì he has previously been a 
programmer and inspired me to take up the subject at college and then at University.</p>

<p>Unfortunately whilst I was at school, there was only the option to study ICT ‚Äì a dull mix of ‚Äòlearning‚Äô to use 
programs from the Microsoft Office suite. I started to notice a lack of other girls during my A-levels, being the 
only girl in my computing class and one of few in maths and physics.</p>

<p>The gender gap at degree level is pretty big; in the UK in 2011-2012 there were 3,500 female computer science 
undergraduate degrees obtained (17.45%), and 16,560 male computer science undergrads obtained (82.55%). I could usually 
count the number of girls in a lecture on one hand (out of 150 students). I was very aware of the gender gap, but 
I was never particularly bothered; I never felt at a disadvantage or discriminated against.</p>

<p>I would say that I almost felt that I had an advantage ‚Äì people would often point out the gender gap and the 
positives of being in the minority. I believe it made me push myself harder ‚Äì I was more motivated to be successful 
and in a way prove that I could be as good as or better than my male counterparts.</p>

<p>Despite feeling this advantage in standing out and having been successful in my degree, I still suffer from a lack of 
confidence. This under-confidence was never so prominent at school; I was able to give presentations and speak publicly 
without much thought. It mainly affects me in areas around my subject (and intelligence) and it does not generally 
extend in the same way to my social life.</p>

<p>This under-confidence I recognise in myself is reflected in a large majority of women (rarely men) I have come across 
‚Äì friends, family, classmates and colleagues; It can be as subtle as the language you use. I was told off by a family 
friend recently when talking about a project I had been working on ‚Äì I mentioned that I was ‚Äúreally lucky that the 
results were so good‚Äù.  The problem with this kind of language is that I‚Äôm instantly dismissing all the hard work 
and time I spent on that project when I should be proud!</p>

<p>I am now working as a software engineer, and I am pleased to say I have never felt any kind of discrimination 
thus far in my career (all 9 months of it!). Additionally, I no longer suffer quite the same low confidence now; 
I still battle with it, but I can stand up in front of an audience and say the things I want to say, and I rarely have 
issues with being too scared to ask the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô questions in meetings or speak my mind.</p>

<p>This is down to deliberate practice that has been supported by the company I work for ‚Äì we focus heavily on growth 
(a privilege not everyone has straight out of education). We need to change the way things are for young girls 
(and boys too!), starting with schools &amp; the national curriculum. No more Microsoft Office!</p>

<p>Despite the ubiquity of computing nowadays, young girls are not inspired to take up programming. It boggles my 
mind that it wasn‚Äôt an option for me at school, but hopefully that‚Äôs changing ‚Äì we need talented computer 
scientists from both genders.</p>
