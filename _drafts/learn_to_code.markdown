## Learn to code

I'm also going to be breaking down software engineering, programming, and coding over on @okay_code, if you're new to
tech and interested. Anyone can learn to code, and it's an incredibly versatile skill that can open up a whole variety of
opportunities. It's not only for the "nerds" and gamers or "super smart" people, despite the stereotypes that still
exist; coding is accessible to anyone with a little motivation and determination. Maybe you'll find it's something
you truly love and enjoy! Learning to code can be a great way to challenge yourself and helps to develop
problem-solving skills, as well as giving you the potential to create something amazing. So, if you're looking
for a new hobby, why not give coding a try?
